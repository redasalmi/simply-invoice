# Simply Invoice

Under construction... ðŸš§

## Roadmap

- save data in browser storage using a client loader, add a warning about
  cleaning browser history
- save data in an online storage provider (drive, mega, dropbox...) using a
  server loader if possible
- add a default company (first one available, can be modified later) that will
  be used in all new invoices
- add a choose company, customer and services select input using saved data when
  creating a new invoice
- add multiple templates, an invoice will be saved with a given template but can
  still be downloaded and previewed with any available template
- look into making this a PWA
